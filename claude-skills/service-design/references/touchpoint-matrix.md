## Creating a Touchpoint Inventory

### Step 1: Map All Touchpoints
Sources for identifying touchpoints:
- Customer journey maps
- Service blueprints
- Customer interviews
- Support ticket analysis
- Web/app analytics
- Employee interviews

### Step 2: Categorize Touchpoints
Organize by:
- Journey stage
- Channel type
- Customer segment
- Business function

### Step 3: Document Details
For each touchpoint:
- Write clear description
- Identify owner
- Define customer goal
- Note current performance

### Step 4: Assess and Prioritize
Evaluate each touchpoint:
- Customer importance (impact on satisfaction)
- Business importance (impact on conversion/retention)
- Current performance (how well it works today)
- Improvement effort (resources needed to improve)

### Step 5: Create Improvement Roadmap
Prioritize touchpoints by:
- High importance + Low performance = Fix immediately
- High importance + High performance = Maintain
- Low importance + Low performance = Consider eliminating
- Low importance + High performance = Potential over-investment

## Touchpoint Assessment Criteria

### Customer Experience Metrics

| Criterion | Description | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Findability** | Can customers find this touchpoint? | Task success rate |
| **Usability** | Is it easy to use? | Effort score, errors |
| **Effectiveness** | Does it accomplish customer goal? | Completion rate |
| **Emotion** | How does it make customers feel? | Sentiment, feedback |
| **Consistency** | Is it consistent with other touchpoints? | Brand audit |

### Operational Metrics

| Criterion | Description | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Reliability** | Does it work consistently? | Uptime, error rate |
| **Efficiency** | Resources required to deliver? | Cost per interaction |
| **Scalability** | Can it handle volume? | Capacity utilization |
| **Maintainability** | Easy to update and improve? | Change frequency |

## Touchpoint Prioritization Matrix

```mermaid

    title Touchpoint Prioritization Matrix
    x-axis Low Customer Importance --> High Customer Importance
    y-axis Low Current Performance --> High Current Performance
    quadrant-1 Maintain Excellence
    quadrant-2 Potential Over-Investment
    quadrant-3 Deprioritize or Eliminate
    quadrant-4 Fix First - High Priority
```

*Quadrant interpretation: Focus on quadrant-4 (high importance, low performance) for immediate improvements. Quadrant-1 touchpoints are working well—maintain them.*

## Omnichannel Consistency Audit

Check touchpoints across channels for:

| Consistency Element | Question |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Information** | Is the same information available across channels? |
| **Functionality** | Can customers do the same things across channels? |
| **Design** | Do touchpoints look and feel like the same brand? |
| **Handoff** | Can customers seamlessly switch between channels? |
| **History** | Is customer history available across channels? |

## Best Practices

1. **Be comprehensive** – Include all touchpoints, not just digital
2. **Involve all teams** – Each touchpoint has an owner
3. **Update regularly** – New touchpoints are constantly created
4. **Connect to journey** – Touchpoints are journey steps, not isolated moments
5. **Measure what matters** – Focus on customer-centric metrics
6. **Prioritize ruthlessly** – You can't improve everything at once
7. **Consider the ecosystem** – Partner touchpoints affect your brand too
